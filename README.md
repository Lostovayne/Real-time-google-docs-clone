## Functionality Overview

### Real-Time Collaboration

The application uses WebSockets to enable real-time collaboration. When a user makes changes to a document, those changes are sent to the server and broadcasted to all connected clients, ensuring that everyone sees the latest version of the document.

### Rich Text Editing

The rich text editor allows users to format their text easily. Users can apply styles such as bold, italics, and underline, as well as create lists and insert code blocks. The editor is built using Tiptap, which provides a flexible and extensible editing experience.

### Document Management

Users can manage their documents through a simple interface. They can create new documents, open existing ones, and delete documents they no longer need. Each document is stored in a database and can be accessed using its unique ID.

### Comments and Suggestions

Users can leave comments on specific sections of the document. This feature is useful for providing feedback or asking questions about certain parts of the text. Comments can be resolved or deleted as needed.

### Version History

The application maintains a version history for each document. Users can view previous versions and revert to them if necessary, providing a safety net against accidental changes.
